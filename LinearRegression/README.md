ComputeCost.m - compute the cost function value
ComputeGradient.m - compute the gradient
GradientDescent.m - implements the gradient descent algorithm.
StochasticGradientDescent.m - implements the stochastic gradient
	descent algorithm. 
practice4a.m - perform the tasks required for problem 4a
practice4b.m - perform the tasks required for problem 4b
practice4c.m - perform the tasks required for problem 4c

The code can be run by calling the function corrisponding to the
question.  The functions take the paths to the train and test data.
They write out information that must be included in the answer and the
generate a EPS figure with the corrisponding name as required.
